# Nautral History Museum Website: Graphic Communication Course
## This is not the real NHM website!
I am an A-Level Graphic Communication who was asked to create a webpage for a fictional brief. I do not wish to cause confusion and harm from this website.
All links to the real website have been removed for this purpose. The form below does not connect to anything either.
