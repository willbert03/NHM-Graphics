# Nautral History Museum Website: Graphic Communication Course
An edited version of the Natural History Museum's website, using own assets for own brief. 
View the webpage [here](https://willbert03.github.io/NHM-Graphics/).
This is a school project and I have no means of causing false information around the museum. 
To view the real page, go to [this website](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/).
